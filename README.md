**Welcome to the Decentralized Architectural Competition project! This groundbreaking initiative embraces the power of blockchain technology to facilitate an architectural design competition, offering a transparent, secure, and inclusive platform.**

## Introduction

The project leverages Ethereum's and Algorand's smart contracts to handle competition entries, voting, and declaration of the winner. It demonstrates how traditional architectural competitions can be transformed using blockchain technology, which ensures an immutable, secure, and decentralized system for both the organizers and the participants.

In our system, each participant submits their architectural design by interacting with the smart contract, which also requires them to pay an entry fee, thereby effectively registering them for the competition. Participants' entries are stored on the blockchain, ensuring their immutability and transparency.

Voting is also carried out through the smart contract, allowing a transparent tally of votes for each entry. The system is designed such that each participant gets one vote, and they cannot vote after a pre-specified deadline.

Moreover, our project also includes an automatic prize distribution system. Once the voting deadline has been reached and votes are tallied, the prize money (accumulated from entry fees) is automatically transferred to the winner's account, ensuring a prompt reward system.

This project is a showcase of how we can harness blockchain's potential to transform various sectors, including architecture and design. The system's fairness, transparency, and security make it an exciting development for future architectural competitions, where decentralized systems can pave the way for global participation and unbiased results.

The following sections will delve deeper into the technicalities of our Ethereum and Algorand smart contracts, providing a comprehensive understanding of the project's inner workings. Join us in revolutionizing architectural competitions!

## Quick Start

...

## Contract

This contract allows for submitting entries and voting for them. Entry names and votes are stored in the global state of the contract. Voting is open for one week from the time of contract deployment. Please note, entry names are passed as arguments to the submit and vote functions, so the organizer's off-chain software will need to keep track of these.

Remember, TEAL is not Turing-complete and has many limitations compared to Solidity, so some complex or specific functionality might not be possible. Always make sure to thoroughly test your smart contract before deploying it to production.

### Authors

This is an open-source project by the **[Block Foundation](https://www.blockfoundation.io "Block Foundation website")**.

The Block Foundation mission is enabling architects to take back initiative and contribute in solving the mismatch in housing through blockchain technology. Therefore the Block Foundation seeks to unschackle the traditional constraints and construct middle ground between rent and the rigidity of traditional mortgages.
