In this PyTeal code, we're defining the basic structure for a smart contract:

When the smart contract is initialized, we're setting up hasVoted and voteCount local states for the account with a 0 value.
There are different branches in the contract logic depending on whether it's the first time the contract is being called (i.e., it's being initialized), the contract is being updated, a user is voting, or a user is querying the current vote count.
In the vote branch, we're asserting that the user has not voted before, then updating the hasVoted and voteCount states.
In the vote count query branch, we're simply returning the current vote count.
This is a simplified contract and lacks a lot of the functionality and security features the Solidity version has, such as an entry fee, deadline enforcement, and winner declaration.

Please note that converting a Solidity contract to PyTeal is not straightforward due to the differences in the languages. For instance, TEAL is a stack-based language and doesn't have built-in support for things like arrays or complex data structures, whereas Solidity is a Turing-complete language with support for a wide variety of complex data types and operations.

This is a basic implementation and the specific use case and the complexity of the smart contract could lead to major differences in the PyTeal version. PyTeal and Algorand do not currently support all the features available in Ethereum and Solidity. It is recommended to check Algorand's capabilities before trying to implement a complex smart contract.

Expanding on the PyTeal contract to handle similar functionality as in the Solidity contract, we can define states to count votes for multiple entries, and to check whether voting is still open.

However, due to the limited functionality of TEAL/PyTeal compared to Solidity (e.g., lack of loops, complex data structures, and contract-triggered transactions), we cannot directly convert the Solidity contract. Specifically, winner declaration and automatic money distribution can't be handled directly within the smart contract in PyTeal. This will have to be an off-chain process handled by the organizer's software.

Here's an expanded example which allows multiple entries and voting, but doesn't handle the winner declaration or prize distribution:



This version of the contract allows for submitting entries and voting for them. Entry names and votes are stored in the global state of the contract. Voting is open for one week from the time of contract deployment. Please note, entry names are passed as arguments to the submit and vote functions, so the organizer's off-chain software will need to keep track of these.

Remember, TEAL is not Turing-complete and has many limitations compared to Solidity, so some complex or specific functionality might not be possible. Always make sure to thoroughly test your smart contract before deploying it to production.
